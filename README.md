# Line of Sight ArcGIS

## Overview

This project is an HTML site displaying an ArcGIS web map with 21 repeaters feature layer displayed. I made this to familiarize myself with the ArcGIS javascript api. To use the software, you can click on each repeater marker and see it's frequency and offset. You can filter the list of frequencies to a range on the left pane. A feature I am still trying to get working is to use the LineOfSight functionality to see if there are line of sight obstructions between two points which would hinder VHF radio transmissions.

## Development Environment

While creating this page, I used Visual Studio Code to write HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also used the ArcGIS developer website to generate the feature layer displaying the repeaters. I also used the ArcGIS Javascript api.
